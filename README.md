Color picker for web developers/designers.

Use this site to pick color for HTML/CSS. :-)

Use the color picker by clicking and dragging your cursor inside the picker area to highlight a color on the right. Input Hex, RGB, HSL or CMYK values to search for a particular color in the fields below the color swatch; click the swatch to add it to your palette. After selecting a color, experiment with different harmonies by using the dropdown below the color picker.
